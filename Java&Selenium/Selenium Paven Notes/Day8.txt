Interface
-------------------
An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. 
Interface contains final and static variables.
Interface contains abstract methods.
An abstract method is a method contains definition but not body.
Methods in interface are public by default.
Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
We can define interface with interface keyword.
A class extends another class, an interface extends another interface but a class implements an interface.
We can create Object reference for Interface but we cannot instantiate interface.

package is collection of classes/interfaces/other files.

import

create sub package

2 types of packages
-----
1) user defined packages
2) built-in packages
